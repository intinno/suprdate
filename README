=== Suprdate

  Date traversal, iteration, and event occurrence rules DSL for ruby (written with 1.8.6)
  
  === Installation
  
    cd ~ # or wherever you want it installed
    git clone git://github.com/olliesaunders/suprdate.git
    cd suprdate
    bin/run_spec # check to see that it's working
    bin/irb # this script requires and includes the library; just start playing!
    
  === Inclusion
  
    require PATH_TO_SUPRDATE + '/lib/suprdate'
    include Suprdate # recommended within the scope you want to use Suprdate
    
  === Features
  
    Suprdate consists of two layers. 
    
      1. Object that represent dates (Year, Month and Day etc.) These are used for the purposes of
         traversal, iteration and arithmatic.
      2. Event occurrence DSL for expressing calendar event rules. This sits on top of the first 
         layer and provides you with objects from the first layer as a result.
    
    I'd like to first begin by going through the features of the second layer, DSL, but it doesn't 
    yet exist (see TODO for how it might work when it's done) so we'll start with the first layer:
    
    >> a = Year(2008) # => 2008
    >> a.leap? # => true
    >> a += 1 # => 2009
    >> a.leap? # => false
    >> a.months.class # => Array
    >> a.months[0..2] # => [2009-01, 2009-02, 2009-03]
    >> a.since(Year(2000)) # => 9
    >> a.month # => 2009-01
    >> a.day # => 2009-01-01
    >> a[2]   # => 2009-02
    >> a[2, 3, :jun] # => [2009-02, 2009-03, 2009-06]
    >> a.days[0..2] # => [2009-01-01, 2009-01-02, 2009-01-03]
    >> a.days.nitems # => 365

    >> b = Month(2008, 1) # => 2008-01
    >> b += 2 # => 2008-03
    >> b.to_s # => "2008-03"
    >> b.to_sym # => :mar
    >> b[1]     # => 2008-03-01
    >> b[1, 3] # => [2008-03-01, 2008-03-03]
    >> b[1, 3, -1, -3] # => [2008-03-01, 2008-03-03, 2008-03-31, 2008-03-29]
    >> b    # => 2008-03
    >> b > Year(2008) # => true
    >> b > Year(2009) # => false
    >> b > Month(2008, 2) # => true
    >> b > Month(2008, 3) # => false
    >> b += 24 # => 2010-03
    >> a.month # => 2009-01
    >> a.day # => 2009-01-01
